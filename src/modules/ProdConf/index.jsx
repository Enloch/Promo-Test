// A product configurator is a type of tool that allows users to customize and configure products to their specific needs or preferences.Here's one way to create a product configurator using React:

//     Create a new component called ProductConfigurator that will render the configurator.This component should be stateful, and should have a state variable called config that stores the current configuration of the product.

//     In the ProductConfigurator component, create a series of input fields(e.g.select, checkbox, range) to allow users to configure the product.Each input field should update the config state when its value changes.

//     Create a function handleChange that will be passed down to each input field to update the state based on the changed value.

//     Pass down the config state to a child component that will render a representation of the product based on the current configuration.

//     In the render() method, Render all the options for user to configure the product

//     Add a button or a link which when clicked, it'll take the user to a summary of the configuration and show the total price based on the configuration.

// Here's an example of a simple ProductConfigurator component:
class ProductConfigurator extends React.Component {
  state = {
    config: {
      color: 'red',
      size: 'medium',
      addons: []
    },
  }
  handleChange = (event) => {
    const { name, value } = event.target
    this.setState(prevState => ({ config: { ...prevState.config, [name]: value } }))
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Product Configurator</h3>
        <div>
          <label>
            Color:
            <select name="color" onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.config.color}>
              <option value="red">Red</option>
              <option value="blue">Blue</option>
              <option value="green">Green</option>
            </select>
          </label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>
            Size:
            <select name="size" onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.config.size}>
              <option value="small">Small</option>
              <option value="medium">Medium</option>
              <option value="large">Large</option>
            </select>
          </label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>
            Addons:
            <input type="checkbox" name="addons" value="addon1" onChange={this.handleChange} checked={this.state.config.addons.includes('addon1')} /> Addon 1
            <input type="checkbox" name="addons" value="addon2" onChange={this.handleChange} checked={this.state.config.addons.includes('addon2')} /> Addon 2
          </label>
        </div>
        {/* <ProductPreview config={this.state.config} /> */}
        <button onClick={this.submit}>Submit</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default ProductConfigurator;

// Here's how you can complete the product configurator example:

//     Create a child component called ProductPreview that will render a representation of the product based on the current configuration.The ProductPreview component should receive the config state as a prop and use it to render the appropriate product variant.

//     Create a function called submit or onSubmit that will be called when the user clicks the submit button, that function will be in charge of sending the final configuration for example to an api for further processing

//     In the submit function, you can use the config state to generate a summary of the configuration, calculate the total price and take any other action that is necessary before sending the data to the server

// This is just a basic example of how to create a product configurator using React, but you can extend it to include more options, dynamic pricing calculation, and more.

// It is important to keep in mind that this example is just a guide and may not cover all the cases, it is important that you validate the inputs, handle errors and think in security too.

// Sure! Here's an example of a simple ProductPreview component that uses the config prop to render a representation of the product based on the current configuration:

// const ProductPreview = (props) => {
//   const { config } = props;
//   return (
//     <div className="product-preview">
//       <h4>Product Preview</h4>
//       <div>
//         <div>Color: {config.color}</div>
//         <div>Size: {config.size}</div>
//         <div>Addons: {config.addons.join(', ')}</div>
//       </div>
//       <img src={`/images/${config.color}-${config.size}.jpg`} alt="product preview" />
//     </div>
//   );
// }

// This component expects to receive the config prop with the current configuration of the product, and uses it to display the selected color, size, and addons.It also uses an image that is based on the color and size of the product.
//   It's important to note that the img src it's just an example and you should use a proper image URL or be sure that your project has those images in the correct path

// It's important to keep in mind that this is a very simple example, you can add as many interactions or dynamic effects as you want and change it to your needs
